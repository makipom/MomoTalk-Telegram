# MomoTalk 【Unofficial】
A theme for `Telegram Desktop` designed to resemble the `MomoTalk` messaging app from the mobile RPG [`Blue Archive`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Archive). This theme works only with the `Desktop` version of `Telegram` and is not compatible with the `Android`, `iOS`, or `Web` versions.
